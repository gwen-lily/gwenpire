I convene the parliament of gwen! ababa! that's something cute to call it, so the parliament of gwen, it shall be in git! On the hub, as it were. So, let's establish a covenant like witches! or communes! Let's lay down a few ground rules that set the vibe!

## Communication
Communication is important! Explain how others can work with you at your best & worst! Find what digital, written, and verbal means of access work best!

## Egality & Equity
We are all equals in this. Let's create some sort of mutual stake! When we make investments, ensure all individuals have access to the growth opportunities.

## Community & Fraternity
Cammraderie! Friendship! All genders are welcome, gender is a fuck! as they say. gwen is a slutty bitch and loves to socialize with you, and the more you do, the less time she spends out on the street ehehe!!

## Liberty
Freedom to explore oneself! Whatever strange and wonderful corner of the ND & NB sphere you fall into, you are welcome to express & live it.

## Polygamy
gwen is a hyperpolygamous bunny slut! All are welcome to be as exclusive or 

## Privacy
Everybody deserves a place of their own, at any time as needed! The more the merrier in general, but when assigning living spaces, make sure that people can get some time to themselves as needed

## Responsbility
Everybody should have some contribution to be spoken for. It could be simple and minimal depending on the needs of the person! Anything & everything, from music to acts of light service! You wouldn't have made it this far if you didn't have something to offer :3 Watch out for others!

Addendum, nobody gets to keep a terribly messy room, we have a maid (gwen) for this, you'd be a fool not to use it.

## Toxicity & Sobriety
Drugs are pretty good! But we want to make sure we create a place where everyone is welcome to partake or abstain :3. To that effect, keep the peer pressure to a responsbile minimum, respect boundaries, and keep especially damaging & dangerous drugs away. I also encourage you to take a sobriety break every once in awhile. It helps put your usage into perspective

## Loyalty
Loyalty is greatly rewarded in kind! Betrayal is met with confusion and possible removal! I don't pretend to know what a good removal process is, but I'll come up with something eventually.

"I solemnly swear to be a good puppy [or whatever]".

## Safety
Respect boundaries. Respect hard limits. Know your play partner! Know their safe word. Know what you're doing! Don't put someone else in danger!

## Tranquility
Responsibile conflict resolution & avoidance of triggering what I assume is a very familiar dislike of behaviors associated with destructive conflict resolution.
