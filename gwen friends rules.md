# rules
0. ADULTS ONLY. MINORS BEGONE. Come back when you're 18, I promise it's for the best
1. be cool and kind and queer
	1. respect pronouns
	2. respect vibes
	3. respect consent
2. there are very few channels, use them broadly and get along. make a thread if you simply must discuss some topic.
	1. no excessive channels
	2. no excessive flair roles
3. everyone needs to know gwen. wanna invite a friend? send them my contact info and I'll chat with em ;3. this is the gwen friends :3.
	1. flustered-gwen#6307 (discord)
	2. gwen.aurora.lily@gmail.com (email)
4. no kink shaming (unless that's your thing hehehe). we're all strange. nobody needs unnecessary grief over that.
	1. my hard limits are raceplay, findom, & scat. I think it's pretty fair to ban those topics.
5. uhhhhmmmm 
6. if you're a thrall (partner, partner-in-formation, girlfriend, boyfriend, doll thrall, wife, etc) I also present to you my polyconstitution, read it at your leisure! It might explain a bit about what gwen likes to do! It is [[the covenant]].
	1. See something you're confused about? Got an idea? Want a special rule just for you? Make a pull request, nerd!!
